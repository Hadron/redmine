redmine (3.0~20140825-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Running redmine as an unprivileged user re-using the system-wide
  installation as a base (as previously documented in README.Debian) is not
  supported anymore.

redmine (2.1.4+dfsg2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  An old secret session keys has to be replaced due incompatible changes
  in the ruby classes, which would make redmine inaccessible for all
  users with the old sessions cached in browser cookies.
  The old session keys can be found in /etc/redmine/default/session.yml.dpkg-old

redmine (2.1.4+dfsg2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This is work in progress.  It might and probably will break your
  existing redmine application, so unless you understand ruby and you
  want to help with debugging the Redmine 2 packaging, you should stop
  now.  Seriously - this package in current state will probably break
  your wash machine, eat your socks and run away with your husband/wife.
  You should cancel the upgrade RIGHT NOW!
