Comment:
 Ruby FPDF is released under a permissive license,
 similar to that of FPDF. I only ask that you retain the copyright notice at the top
 of the source file. You may make modifications to FPDF, but if you redistribute
 those modifications, make it clear in a comment immediately before or after the
 copyright notice that you have modified it. I also wouldn't mind if you sent patches
 back to me, but you are not strictly required to do so.
